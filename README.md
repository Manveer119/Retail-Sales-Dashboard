# Retail-Sales-Dashboard
This project analyzes a retail transactions dataset to understand how sales revenue changes over time and which product categories generate the most revenue. The goal was to build an interactive Excel dashboard using PivotTables and PivotCharts to help track business performance and identify trends quickly.
